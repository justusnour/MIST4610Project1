# MIST4610 Project 1

# Our team designed a hospital management system that tracks patient care, appointments, billing, and staff operations. The database supports key functions like scheduling, prescriptions, lab tests, and insurance processing. It helps management monitor patient flow, department performance, and financial outcomes.
